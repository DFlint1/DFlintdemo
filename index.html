              <h1>Hello, I am a full stack developer dedicated to building innovative, new web applications. </h1>
              <p>Lately, I have just finished a 24-week intensive web development certificate program at the University of Texas at Austin. In this class, I have skillfully learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, Firebase, MySql, API/JSON, Ajax, Command Line and much more. The projects and apps I have in this class have made me a great programmer ready to break in and compete for a new career in the industry. This is what I am doing now but I have come a long way to get here.</p>

        <h4>I grew up in Joshua, TX and lived there all my grade school years and moved to Austin, TX to go to the University of Texas at Austin where I graduated in 2 Â½ years and majored in Psychology. I went into the business world landing my best job at Lockheed Martin IMS where I managed my way to leading 50 people on my team. It is there where I learned the love for team work and group participation. The company moved to San Antonio or I would be working there to this day because that is how much I loved working there. <h4> I decided to stay in Austin and start up a home-building business with my husband, whom, I have been married for 23 years...the love of my life. He is someone I want to grow old with who shares my dreams of having a fun, happy life. We are blessed with one amazing daughter who is 11 years old who loves hearing what new projects I am working on each week. I have family living in all parts of Texas and we get together often. I have a wonderful life living in the suburbs of Austin, TX and it only seems to be getting better. <h4>
For the past 16 years, we have been building homes in the Austin and surrounding area. As an industry, professional, I have direct knowledge of office development, office management, staff development and project management as well as marketing, business legal and accounting methods. I ran the IT department as well as the accounting and marketing departments as VP of Operations for Flint Estate Builders, a small private company mainly consisting of subcontractors and a small staff; however, building homes in the Austin area averaging over a million in sales a year. I have learned a lot from being an entrepreneur in business that has given me the skills I need to succeed in anything I set my mind to. <h4> I am now turning the page to a new adventure since my husband has moved on to commercial building and now I am looking to fulfill my dream of a new building career of my own-Web Development. In this field, I believe I will be able to use the newest applications that will intrigue my inner curiosities and build projects with others that will make a difference while providing me with the invaluable feeling of satisfaction. <h4>
I have an extensive background in project management, home building and accounting and yet I have always found time to foster my love for web applications. I have edited, designed websites for personal and business. I learned various AutoCAD, accounting, design, and social media web applications for work as a hobby. My other interests include writing short stories, playing a penny whistle, hugging on my ferrets, and hiking.</h4>

              <p>My Favorite project so far has been Find. I enjoyed designing the front end to this project on a team of developers. I had fun putting coming up with a simple yet eye catching theme to attract people to the site.</p>
